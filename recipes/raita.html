    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This 10-minute recipe is super simple, yet such a classic side for Indian dishes.</p>
    <p>So if raita is so simple, why is it so easy to get it wrong? Raita is so much more than just yogurt mixed in with
        some veggies – the seasoning for raita can sometimes be difficult to get just right. In this recipe, I’ll share
        my raita spice mix that will make your raita go from average to restaurant-quality!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Kala Namak</li>
        <li>Veggies</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Roasted Cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>A pinch of red chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, keep a large mixing bowl handy. Add the yogurt and all the seasonings. Whisk or beat with a fork
            to combine to a smooth mixture.</li>
        <li>Add in all the veggies - grated carrots, diced tomatoes, onions, and cucumber.</li>
        <li>Mix well</li>
        <li>And that's it! Your raita is now ready to be enjoyed with some biryani or pair it with any of your favorite
            Indian recipes.</li>
    </ol>
