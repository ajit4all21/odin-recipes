    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>When the thought of biryani comes to mind, a word that comes to mind almost immediately is dum. Dum Biryani, a
        one-pot dish of aromatic spices and delightful flavors, is a favorite. It is made by slow-cooking the
        ingredients in a sealed, heavy-bottomed vessel for hours or even overnight in some cases.</p>
    <p>Slow cooking works like magic to infuse the flavors of the various spices and herbs into the meat, making it
        unbelievably tender. This style of cooking, known traditionally as dum pukht, is not limited to biryanis but
        also includes korma, nihari, haleem, raan, other meat curries, and even dal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.1 lb of chicken, with a few slits made on each piece</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of ginger and garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of biryani masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>A pinch of red chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, salt, turmeric, lemon juice, and chili powder with the
            chicken. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Parboil basmati rice with whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom) and salt until it's 70% cooked. Drain
            and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnish. In the same
            pan, cook marinated chicken on medium heat for 5‚Äì7 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a pot, layer half the rice over the chicken. Sprinkle fried onions, chopped coriander, and mint. Add the
            remaining rice and repeat the toppings.</li>
        <li>Drizzle saffron-infused milk or ghee over the top. Cover with a tight lid or seal with dough and cook on low
            heat for 20‚Äì25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let it sit for 10 minutes. Then, gently mix from the sides to avoid breaking the rice.</li>
        <li>Plate the biryani with raita or salan and dig in! üçõüî•</li>
